# Simulation of a 3D modeled scene with hierarchy

This WebGL project allows users to control a 3D modeled helicopter and observe its movement in a virtual scene. The helicopter can take off and land vertically (using the Up and Down arrow keys) and move in a circular path, around the y-axis, only moving forward in its trajectory (using the Left arrow key).

- The user can also move the helicopter manually with the 'RDFG' keys after switching to manual mode with the 'z' key;
- The buildings are randomly generated and the user can request a new generation by pressing 'm';
- The user can change some settings using the GUI on the top right of the screen;

#### This was a group project for the **Computer Graphics and Interfaces** class at FCT-UNL.
